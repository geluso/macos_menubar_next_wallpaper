# Next Wallpaper

This is a menu bar app that triggers changing to the next wallpaper image in
MacOS.

I have my laptop set up with a directory of hundreds of my favorite photos. Not
every photo is cropped and scaled to show up well as a desktop photo. Instead
of curating the set of photos I'd like an app that simply allows me to manually
skip through photos I don't like as desktop wallpapers.

## TODO

* Display app icon in menu bar instead of using `systemImage: "photo"`
* Refer to the `TriggerNextDesktop.scpt` file by bundling it in the application
  instead of hard coding it in my own user path.
